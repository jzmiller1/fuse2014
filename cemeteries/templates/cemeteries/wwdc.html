    <p>During World War I there were three registrations. The first, on June 5, 1917, was for all men between the ages
      of 21 and 31. The second, on June 5, 1918, registered those who attained age 21 after June 5, 1917. (A
      supplemental registration was held on August 24, 1918, for those becoming 21 years old after June 5, 1918. This
      was included in the second registration.) The third registration was held on September 12, 1918, for men age 18
      through 45.<br>
